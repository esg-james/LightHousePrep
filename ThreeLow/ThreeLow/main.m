//maybe change die initialization in gamecontroller to be only prompted when the user enters roll
//use inputString isEqualTo to check for roll
//if roll, add die
//don't need to return anything from remove die, simple function call

//if 1, 2, 4, 5, add to score
//if 3, don't add to score
//score tallied at end of game, when there are no die left(?)
//who am I rolling against, another player? An object? <--- probably and object that basically does the same thing after my turn completes?
//features to add - game loop /held die:this will allow user to freeze die? using indexes of array element to  freeze them, set them to a BOOL value that means they are perhaps deleted from one array but added to another? maybe if I add an array to an array and then remove the objects that aren't to be rolled (store their values as score?) then use that new array to continue game? <---- this will be hard
//^similar, but we want to unhold if the user makes a mistake, for these methods listed, I need to display the die face for ease
//reset held die, should be similar to the unhold die method, remember that holding and unholding are basically just switching the arrays they are in?
//score keeper
